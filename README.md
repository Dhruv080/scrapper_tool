Astrologer Data Scraper

Description
This Python script automates the process of scraping data from a website that lists astrologers. It captures various details such as names, languages spoken, specialties, years of experience, pricing, and ratings. The script uses Selenium for web interaction and is designed to handle multiple retries if elements are not immediately available.

Features
Scrapes astrologer profiles including detailed attributes.
Handles dynamic loading of content and retries on failure.
Saves scraped data into a JSON file for easy use in applications.

Installation
To run this script, you need Python installed on your machine along with several packages. You can install all required packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the script using Python. Make sure you have Chrome installed as it uses a ChromeDriver to perform the scraping.
python script.py

Configuration
The script runs in headless mode by default.
Modify the scrape_astrologers function if you need to scrape a different website or change the behavior of the data collection.
Output
Data is saved in a file named astrologers_data.json in a JSON format, with each line representing a single astrologer's profile.

Error Handling
The script includes robust error handling, with specific exceptions caught for various potential failures during scraping. It also attempts retries on known recoverable errors.
